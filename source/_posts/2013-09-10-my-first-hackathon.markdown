Recently attended [PayPal Battle Hack](http://battlehack.org/miami) in Miami:

Some highlights:

* Spent a weekend working on something completely different from my day job (but still within my profession)
* Awesome people and amazing hacks
* Great food
* [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) for being an early bird
* Didn't complete [our hack](https://github.com/bglomann/fetch-backend), but planning to keep working on it

All in all, a great way to learn a lot in a short time. Highly recommended!
